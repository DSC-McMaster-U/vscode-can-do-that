###### Basics ######
####################
# arrow keys and mouse, duh
print("hello world")

# right/left a word [option + left/right]
num = 6
print("this is a sentence with", num, "words")

# start of line [cmd + left] or [ctrl + a]
# end of line   [cmd + right] or [ctrl + e]
print("go to the start of this line")
print("go to the end of this line")

# start of file [cmd + up]
# end of file [cmd + down]

# combine any of the above commands with shift
# and you select the text as well, try it!
print("hello world") # <- place cursor here and select using cmd + shift + right

# if you're hardcore, never let your hands leave the home row
# by using the below shortcuts to replace the funcationality
# of the arrow keys:
#   up    -> ctrl + p
#   down  -> ctrl + n
#   right -> ctrl + f
#   left  -> ctrl + b

# undo [cmd + z] and redo [cmd + shift + z] work as usual

###### Useful ######

# indent/deindent (also works with selection)
for number in range(10):
    squared = number*number
print(i) # indent me
        print(i*i) # deindent me

# expand selection
print("hello earth")
print(list(range(10, 20, 2)))

# move line up/down (also works with selection)
print("after")
print("middle")
print("before")

### Multi-Line Cursor ###

print("hllo worl")
print("hllo worl")
print("hllo worl")

# cmd + d select next
print("h wld")
print("h wld")
print("h wld")
