# Customization

## Theme

Type "theme" in command pallete. You can edit both the VSCode GUI theme, as well as the icons theme. You can find additional themes in the extensions marketplace.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Type "keyboard".

All keyboard shortcuts in VSCode are stored as json configuration files. You can edit the json directly, or use the built in keyboard shortcuts UI. Better yet, you can search a commmand in command pallete, and click the settings icon next to it (appears when you hover over it with you mouse) to change or add a shortcut for the given command.

## Settings

Type "preferences: settings" in command pallete.

Like the keyboard shortcuts, settings are also stored in a json configuration file, which you can edit directly or use the built in settings UI. As usual, we can always change certain settings through command pallete itself.
