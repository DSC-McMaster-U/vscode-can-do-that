# The Basics: GUI and File Navigation

Here's a short list of useful GUI Navigation shortcuts:

- Command Pallete: `Cmd + Shift + P`
- Go to File: `Cmd + P`
- Toggle Sidebar Visibility: `Cmd + B`
- Toggle Integrated Terminal: `Cmd + J`
- Open Next Editor: `Cmd + Shift + ]`
- Open Previous Editor: `Cmd + Shift + [`
- Close Window: `Cmd + W`

**Note:**
Throughout the workshop, I'll be showing the Mac keyboard shortcuts. Most of the commands in this workshop are found in command pallete, so to find the keybinding for non-mac platforms, simply search it in command pallete. For simplicity here is the mapping of mac meta keys to windows meta keys:
| Mac | Windows |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Cmd | Control (most of the time) |
| Ctrl | Control (some of the time) |
| Option | Alt |
| Shift | Shift |
| Delete | Backspace |
| Return | Enter |
