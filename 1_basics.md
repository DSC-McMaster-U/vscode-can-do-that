# The Basics: GUI and File Navigation

Remember `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` is your best friend!

If you ever forgot the basics, just type "Help" in command pallete and a bunch of helpful options will pop up.

Instead of using the file navigation pane on the left to find files, use `Cmd + P` to search for a file, it's much faster!

Here's a short list of useful GUI Navigation shortcuts:

- Command Pallete: `Cmd + Shift + P`
- Go to File: `Cmd + P`
- Toggle Sidebar Visibility: `Cmd + B`
- Toggle Integrated Terminal: `Cmd + J`
- Close Window: `Cmd + W`
- Open Next Editor: `Cmd + Shift + ]`
- Open Previous Editor: `Cmd + Shift + [`
- Open Recent: `Ctrl + R`
