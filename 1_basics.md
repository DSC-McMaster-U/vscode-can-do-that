# The Basics: GUI and File Navigation

Here's a short list of useful GUI Navigation shortcuts:

- Command Pallete: `Cmd + Shift + P`
- Go to File: `Cmd + P`
- Toggle Sidebar Visibility: `Cmd + B`
- Toggle Integrated Terminal: `Cmd + J`
- Close Window: `Cmd + W`
- Open Next Editor: `Cmd + Shift + ]`
- Open Previous Editor: `Cmd + Shift + [`
- Open Recent: `Ctrl + R`

**Note:**
Throughout the workshop, we'll be showing the Mac keyboard shortcuts. Most of the commands in this workshop are found in command pallete, so to find the keybinding, simply search it in command pallete. For simplicity here is the mapping of mac meta keys to windows meta keys:
| Mac    | Windows                    |
|--------|----------------------------|
| Cmd    | Control (most of the time) |
| Ctrl   | Control (some of the time) |
| Option | Alt                        |
| Shift  | Shift                      |
| Delete | Backspace                  |
| Return | Enter                      |

Remember `Cmd + Shift + P` is your best friend!

Another useful one is Go to File (`Cmd + P`). Instead of using the file explorer bar on the left to open files, `Cmd + P` let's you quickly search for a file, it's much faster!

Type "Help" in command pallete for help options.
