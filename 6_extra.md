# Customization

## Theme

Type "theme" in command pallete.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Type "keyboard".

All keyboard shortcuts in VSCode are stored as json configuration files. You can edit the jsons directly, or use the built in keyboard shortcuts UI. Or, better yet, you can search the commmand in command pallete, and click the settings icon next to it (appears when you hover over it with you mouse).

Let's add a shortcut for closing the activity bar. Type "toggle activity" in the command pallete. We'll map if to cmd/ctrl + shift + a.

If you ever forget a shortcut, you can always type the action into command pallete, which will tell you what the shorcut is (if it exists).

There's also a helpful key bindings cheat sheet for basics commands, that can be found by typing "help: keyboard" into command pallete.

## Settings

Type "preferences: settings" in command pallete.

Like the keyboard shortcuts, settings are also stored in a json configuration file, which you can edit directly or use the built in settings UI. As usual, we can always change certain settings through command pallete itself.

Type "Toggle breadcrumbs" in the command pallete.
