# these commands are the basics, so you can't find them in command pallete
# however, past the basics section, most (if not all) the commands listed
# should be avaliable in command pallete (just search the name!)

# arrow keys, mouse, and scroll work as normal, duh
print("hello world")

# right/left a word [option + left/right]
print("this is a sentence with words")

# start of line [cmd + left] or [ctrl + a]
# end of line   [cmd + right] or [ctrl + e]
print("go to the start of this line")
print("go to the end of this line")

# start of file [cmd + up]
# end of file [cmd + down]

# combine any of the above commands with shift
# and you select the text as well, try it!
print("hello world") # <- place cursor here and select using cmd + shift + right

# if you're hardcore, never let your hands leave the home row
# by using the below shortcuts instead of the arrow keys:
#   up    -> ctrl + p
#   down  -> ctrl + n
#   right -> ctrl + f
#   left  -> ctrl + b

print("hello earth")
print(list(range(10, 20, 2)))
